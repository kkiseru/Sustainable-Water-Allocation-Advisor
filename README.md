# 💧 Sustainable Water Allocation Advisor  
**Supporting SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation**

---

## 🌍 Overview  
The **Sustainable Water Allocation Advisor** is a **fuzzy logic–based decision support system** designed to balance water distribution among **agriculture**, **industry**, and **household** sectors under uncertain **rainfall** and **groundwater depletion** conditions.

This project demonstrates how **computational intelligence** can guide **sustainable water management** by modeling human-like reasoning in resource allocation.  
The fuzzy system supports decision-makers in formulating **adaptive**, **data-driven**, and **fair** water allocation strategies that respond to environmental and consumption changes.
